## WAT

This project is a dead-simple way to keep track of your ideas.
Currently, it has only a command line interface. The interface
is quite limited: you can add idea, view your ideas, and delete
ideas.

Ideas are Marshaled to disk at `~/.ideas.db`.

## Usage

Adding an idea:

`idea add "the most brilliant idea for a cat meme ever"`

Listing all your ideas:

`idea list`

Delete the last idea:

`idea pop`
